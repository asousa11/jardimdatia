# Jardim da Tia, a online flower shop (backoffice & frontoffice)
A University project implemented in Laravel.

The goal was to implement a frontoffice, where normal users could send orders to the backoffice where the administrators could manage Â«orders, clients, sales among other things.

It is buggy and some pages don't work since it was developed in 2010 and has never been updated since.
